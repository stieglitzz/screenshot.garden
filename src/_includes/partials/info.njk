                <a href="https://everest-pipkin.com">Everest Pikpin</a> wrote <a href="https://screenshot-garden.neocities.org/build-your-own">a tutorial about how to make your own screenshot garden</a> on <a href="https://www.neocities.com">Neocities</a> but it only works on Mac and Linux. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210718193216/https://screenshot.garden/">The OG screenshot.garden</a> created their screenshot garden with "a variation of a bash script written by <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co/">Brian Crabtree</a>". I use a Windows computer and do not know anything about Bash so I did not not use either of these methods.</p>
